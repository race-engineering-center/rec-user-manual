Technically, if recording starts after the lap is started, Recorder thinks it's an outlap. You can disable ignoring outlaps to record these kinds of laps if needed. Similarly, if replay ended before the lap was ended, Recorder thinks it's an incomplete lap. Disable ignoring incomplete laps to record a lap from a replay that ended before the lap ended.
