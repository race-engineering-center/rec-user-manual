# Workbooks

Analyzer uses tabs to organize different telemetry analysis tools and widgets, allowing you to quickly
navigate through your data and get valuable insights quickly. You can open as many tabs as you want, detach
tabs to move them to another display and save presets for further reuse.

## Add a new tab

To add a new tab press a button with green plus sign in the top right corner of am Analyzer window and choose
the tab type you want to open.

You can also use main menu item "Tabs" to do the same.

You can manually add data to a freshly opened tab, generally it's done by dragging channels from Channel list
(please refer to the corresponding [section](laps.md#channel-list) for details). For details on how to add data
to each specific type of analysis widgets please refer to the corresponding section of this manual.
