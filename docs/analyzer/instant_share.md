# Instant share

You can quickly share your telemetry with teammates by using REC Instant Share feature. It allows you to upload your 
telemetry to the cloud so others can download it. The share is short-lived and will be automatically deleted from the 
server after an hour. You can upload up to 5 laps in a single share.

## Usage

Uploading instant share is available in the Lap library window. Select up to 5 laps from your library, right click on
any of the selected laps and in the context menu click "Upload instant share".

quickly copy all the necessary info to clipboard. Then just send it over any one of your favorite messengers like Discord:
