# Quick start

**Race Engineering Center** supports the following simulators:

- iRacing
- Assetto Corsa
- Assetto Corsa Competizione
- RaceRoom Racing Experience

## Gather telemetry from iRacing

The recommended way to gather telemetry from iRacing is to import telemetry files generated by the sim (.ibt). To do this press the Alt+L hotkey when driving. The little red connection icon should appear on the iRacing sim interface. For more details on saving iRacing telemetry please refer to the iRacing user manual. 

When you finish your laps your telemetry files should be saved in your `Documents/iRacing/telemetry` folder. You can then import them into [Analyzer](analyzer/analyzer.md)

## Recording telemetry with Recorder

To gather telemetry from other sources it's recommended to use [Recorder](recorder/recorder.md) - a real-time telemetry recording tool bundled with Race Engineering Center.
