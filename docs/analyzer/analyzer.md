The REC Analyzer desktop application is designed to provide comprehensive telemetry analysis capabilities for racing 
simulators on your desktop computer. Whether you're a racing professional, a dedicated sim racer, or an enthusiast, 
the Analyzer is here to help you extract valuable insights from your telemetry data and optimize your performance.

## Main features

Visualize and Interpret Data:

  * Explore detailed telemetry data, including speed, acceleration, braking, steering angles, and more
  * Gain insights into your driving techniques and identify areas for improvement
  * Visualize telemetry information through specially designed customizable graphs

Compare and Contrast:

  * Analyze multiple laps or sessions simultaneously to identify patterns and uncover trends
  * Compare your performance with that of other drivers or reference data to benchmark your progress
  * Highlight variations in driving lines, braking points, and cornering strategies for targeted analysis

Performance Optimization:

  * Pinpoint areas of your driving that can be optimized for faster lap times
  * Analyze the effects of setup changes and fine-tune your vehicle configurations

## Telemetry toolbar overview

The main toolbar provides quick access to essential features and windows. 

![Analyzer telemetry toolbar overview](img/analyzer_telemetry_toolbar_overview_src.png "Analyzer telemetry toolbar overview")

1. Connect to data source and start receiving data
2. Open telemetry file (native REC format) from disk
3. Import telemetry file (external format) from disk
4. Open scripting window (see [scripts](scripts.md) for details)
5. Open Lap library window (see [lap library](laplibrary.md) for details)
6. Open preferences window (see [preferences](preferences.md) for details)

!!! Note
    On macOS the telemetry toolbar is hidden by default to save screen space. You can show it by checking the 
    main menu item View -> Toolbars -> Telemetry. All main toolbar features are also available in the main menu.

## Opening telemetry

### Opening REC native telemetry files

Telemetry files saved by REC (.rec extension) can be opened in two different ways. 

If a file is located within local lap library, it can be loaded using lap library window. Open lap library
window, choose laps to load and simply drag them to lap list in the main Analyzer window. Please refer
to the [lap library](laplibrary.md) section for details.
 

If a .rec telemetry file is located outside lap library you can open it 

!!! Note
    We recommend to save laps to lap library if you plan to work with them. Lap library is the most convenient 
    way to organize telemetry files.  

### Importing external files

If your telemetry file is in an external format (non-REC native), REC Analyzer allows you to import it 
using the "Import" menu item. In an import dialog select a file (or multiple files) you want to import,
select a plugin to use for import in a Format dropdown list and hit Open.

REC Analyzer currently supports the following telemetry formats:

- iRacing .ibt files
- CSV files generated by MoTeC (only files converted by mu from iRacing .ibt files were tested, 
other sources are not supported)

!!! Note
    We recommend to save imported laps to library. REC uses compression to reduce telemetry files size
    so this can save a significant amount of disk space.
