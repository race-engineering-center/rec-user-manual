# Instant share

You can quickly share your telemetry with teammates by using REC Instant Share feature. It allows you to upload your 
telemetry to the cloud so others can download it. The share is short-lived and will be automatically deleted from the 
server after an hour. You can upload up to 5 laps in a single share.

## Usage
